# Machine Learning Writers Projects

This repo has simple projects from my AI Engineering book. They teach how to build AI systems with large language models (LLMs). Everything runs on your computer – no money needed, no internet after setup.

## What You'll Find Here
- Projects start easy and get harder.
- Use free tools like Ollama for local AI.
- Good for beginners learning prompting, RAG, testing, and more.

## How to Start
1. Install Ollama from ollama.com.
2. Download a free model: Run `ollama pull phi3.5:mini` in your terminal.
3. Follow each project's folder for steps.
