# Setup Guide for All Projects

Do this once before trying any project.

1. Go to ollama.com and download Ollama for your computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux).
2. Open a terminal (search "cmd" on Windows or "terminal" on Mac/Linux).
3. Type: ollama pull phi3.5:mini  
   (Wait – it downloads a free AI model. Takes 5-10 minutes.)
4. Install Python if you don't have it (download from python.org – version 3.10 or higher).
5. In terminal, type: pip install gradio ollama  

Done! Now you can run projects.
